# ConsoleLoggingSample
A sample using NLog to create custom loggers that include app-specific data in the output.

Demonstrates:
1) API-based NLog configuration
2) Database logging
3) Named loggers (per-class)
4) Custom Logger child class (with app-specific data)
5) Logging app-specific columns to database / output
